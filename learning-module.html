            known in Unicode as Tagalog
            alphabet,
            known in Visayan as
            badlit , and known in Ilocano as kur-itan/kurditan) is an ancient Philippine script derived from Brahmic
            scripts of India and first recorded in the 16th century.
            It continued to be used during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines up until the late 19th century.
            The alphabet is well known because it was carefully documented by Catholic clergy living in the
            Philippines
            during the colonial era.</p>

                  spell”</em></strong> in Tagalog. Baybayin was
              extensively documented by the Spanish. Some have incorrectly attributed the name Alibata to it, but that
              term was coined by Paul Rodríguez Verzosa after the arrangement of letters of the Arabic alphabet (alif,
              ba, ta (alibata), “f” having been eliminated for euphony’s sake).</p>

            <p class="baybayin__def-par">It is clear that baybayin was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, Pangasinan,
              Ilocos, Panay, Leyte and Iloilo, but there is no proof supporting that baybayin reached Mindanao. It seems
              clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way
              before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the
              oldest regions where baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had
              already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used
              elsewhere. There were three somewhat distinct varieties of baybayin in the late 1500s and 1600s, though
              they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script
              across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.</p>

            <p class="baybayin__def-par">Historically Southeast Asia was under the influence of Ancient India, where
              numerous Indianized principalities and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia,
              Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. The influence of Indian culture into these areas
              was given the term Indianization. French archaeologist, George Coedes, defined it as the expansion of an
              organized culture that was framed upon Indian originations of royalty, Hinduism and Buddhism and the
              Sanskrit language. This can be seen in the Indianization of Southeast Asia, Hinduism in Southeast Asia and
              the spread of Buddhism in Southeast Asia. Indian honorifics also influenced the Malay, Thai, Filipino and
              Indonesian honorifics. Examples of these include Raja, Rani, Maharlika, Datu, etc. which were transmitted
              from Indian culture to Philippines via Malays and the Srivijaya empire.[citation needed] Indian Hindu
              colonists played a key role as professionals, traders, priests and warriors.
              Inscriptions have proved that the earliest Indian colonists who settled in Champa and the Malay
              archipelago, came from the Pallava dynasty, as they brought with them their Pallava script. The earliest
              inscriptions in Java exactly match the Pallava script. In the first stage of adoption of Indian scripts,
              inscriptions were made locally in Indian languages. In the second stage, the scripts were used to write
              the local Southeast Asian languages. In the third stage, local varieties of the scripts were developed. By
              the 8th century, the scripts had diverged and separated into regional scripts.</p>

                With the goal to keep the beauty of the Filipino culture, George Ian Joseph ‘Taipan’ Lucero has
                established his self-developed style of Baybayin Fine Art Calligraphy and advocacy called
                ‘CalligraFilipino’, a portmanteau of Calligraphy and Filipino. He explained it as “a movement towards
                strengthening Filipino identity in a globally homogenizing world.” Lucero has had his works featured in
                different exhibitions and has also collaborated with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in
                preserving the beauty and importance of Baybayin.
